## Overview

**jvm-pybind** provides bindings that enable seamless integration between Python and Java code using the Java Native Interface (JNI). This project allows developers to leverage the strengths of both languages, making it easier to create robust applications that can utilize existing Java libraries or frameworks directly from Python.

### Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Directly call Java methods from Python and vice versa.
- **High Performance**: Utilize the efficiency of Java while maintaining the simplicity of Python.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports Java and Python.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that allows developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex inter-language communication.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate how to use jvm-pybind:

```python
from jvm_pybind import JVM

# Start the JVM
jvm = JVM()

# Load a Java class
my_class = jvm.load_class("com.example.MyClass")

# Call a method
result = my_class.myMethod("Hello from Python!")
print(result)

# Stop the JVM
jvm.shutdown()
```
